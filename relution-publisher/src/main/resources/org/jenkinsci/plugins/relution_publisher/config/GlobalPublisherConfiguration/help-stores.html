This plugin allows to publish applications to a Relution Enterprise Appstore as part of the build
process. To do so, add the configuration for one or more stores here, then add the post-build
action <b>Deploy to Relution Enterprise Appstore</b> to a job. You can then select one of the
stores configured here from a drop down list to automatically upload your application file to this
store whenever a build process completes.
